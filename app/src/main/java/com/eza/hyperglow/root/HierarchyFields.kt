/**
 * Resolves a field by walking the superclass chain instead of stopping at the class that was named.
 *
 * A ROM refactor that hoists a field into a base class leaves it perfectly readable at runtime, but
 * `getDeclaredField` on the subclass reports it absent — and an absent field is indistinguishable
 * from a ROM that never had the feature. `XiaomiCapabilityResolver.hasField` probes the same way, so
 * every read site must agree with it: a probe that says a capability is present while its read site
 * fails is worse than not advertising the capability at all.
 *
 * Deliberately keyed on the field, not on its value. A field that exists and legitimately holds null
 * must resolve here, or a null value reads as a missing symbol.
 *
 * Methods are the opposite case and must not walk — see `XiaomiCapabilityResolver.hasMethod`.
