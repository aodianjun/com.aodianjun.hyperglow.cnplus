/**
 * Wraps the existing [SpicyBridgeStore] as a [LyricProducer], so the projection pipeline can
 * consume lyrics through the producer-agnostic boundary.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - [state] is derived from [SpicyBridgeStore.state] by mapping each [SpicyBridgeState] to a
 *   [LyricProducerState]. The `spotify:track:` constraint stays enforced inside
 *   `SpicyBridgeStateReducer` (it never reaches this wrapper).
 * - [connection] is always [ProducerConnection.CONNECTED]: the Spicy bridge is an in-process
 *   ContentProvider/AIDL surface, so it has no async connect/disconnect lifecycle the way the
 *   lyricon subscriber does. It is "connected" whenever the app process is running.
 * - [start]/[stop] are no-ops for the Spicy path: [SpicyBridgeStore] is a process-global
 *   singleton already started by the bridge service; the producer only exposes it. This keeps
 *   the interface symmetric with the lyricon producer without changing Spicy's lifecycle.
