/**
 * Selects which [LyricProducer] feeds the projection pipeline, enforcing the single-active-
 * producer invariant from the contract spec.
 *
 * Contract (see `.archcore/lyricon-integration/lyric-producer-contract.spec.md`):
 * 1. Exposes exactly one [active] flow; at most one producer's state is visible at any instant.
 * 2. WHEN the selected producer is CONNECTED/RECONNECTED and non-stale, forward its state.
 * 3. WHEN the selected producer is DISCONNECTED or its state is stale, clear `active` to null
 *    and MAY fall back to the next connected producer.
 * 4. WHEN the user changes preference, stop emitting the previous producer's state within one
 *    frame and begin emitting the newly selected producer's state only after it reports
 *    CONNECTED.
 *
 * The arbiter is the only entry point projection consumers (AodProjectionEngine) should read;
 * they MUST NOT read SpicyBridgeStore.state directly.
 *
 * Threading: all producer state observations happen on [Dispatchers.Default]; [active] is a
 * [StateFlow] so collectors are race-free. [setPreference] is thread-safe.
 *
 * @param clock injectable monotonic clock (millis); defaults to [SystemClock.elapsedRealtime].
 *   Injected in unit tests so staleness can be advanced without Android.
